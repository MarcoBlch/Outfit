- Run paid acquisition experiments

- Target: €2,000 MRR (200-250 paid users)

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Acquisition Funnel
- Landing page views
- Signups
- Activation (5+ items uploaded)
- Trial starts
- Paid conversions

### Retention Cohorts
- Day 1 return rate
- Day 7 return rate (target: 40%+)
- Day 30 return rate (target: 30%+)
- Day 90 return rate (target: 15%+)

### Monetization
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Affiliate revenue per user (target: €0.50-2.00)
- Trial-to-paid conversion (target: 5-8%)
- Monthly churn (target: <5%)

---

## Critical Success Factors

✅ **Do:**
- Launch fast (Week 6 achievable)
- Talk to users daily (beta), weekly (post-launch)
- Track metrics religiously
- Focus on retention over acquisition
- Build on Phase 4 (shopping differentiator)

❌ **Don't:**
- Build virtual try-on before launch
- Worry about SEO before validation
- Try viral tactics without testing
- Skip beta testing
- Ignore metrics
- Build features users don't request

---

## Decision Points

**After Week 4 (Beta):**
- If <50% activated → Fix onboarding before launch
- If <5% would pay → Rethink pricing/value prop
- If retention <30% Day 7 → Fix core product

**After Month 3:**
- If MRR <€300 → Focus on conversion optimization
- If retention <25% Day 30 → Fix engagement before scaling
- If affiliate ARPU <€0.30 → Improve Phase 4 UI

**After Month 6:**
- If MRR >€2,000 + retention >30% → Consider virtual try-on
- If MRR <€1,000 → Don't scale yet, fix fundamentals
